# README for week 4 project

The tidy data script is named run_analysis.R.  It requires the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

* Unzip the data into a peer directory of the script, so that run_analysis.R is in the same directory as'the UCI Har Dataset' folder after unzipping.  
* Using the R console or R Studio set the working directory to the directory with the script and data folder.
* Run the command `source('run_analysis.R')`
* The tidy dataset will be saved in the local folder in file tidy_dataset.txt
